Application for operating meshes and interacting them using advanced collision detection algorithms. There are only a few simple operating options and algorithms based on
- Boxes
- Convex Polihedra (GJK)
- Concave objects (BSP).


Usage:
arrows, for manipulating active (green) object
+ and -, for zooming active object
z x c v b , for manipulating camera


Objects are highligting by red every time a collision is detected! Have fun:)
